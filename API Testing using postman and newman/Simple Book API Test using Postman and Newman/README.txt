Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed API test of a Simple Book ordering site. 
Here I've used GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE methods for registering client, getting list of books, submitting order, updating order and also deleting order.

Summary: The number of total iteration was 1.Total 11 assertions were run. All of them passed with 0 skipped tests.
