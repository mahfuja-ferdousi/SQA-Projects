Dear, 
I've done API Testing of a Simple Book ordering site. 
Here, I've used GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE methods for registering clients, getting list of books, submitting orders, updating orders and deleting orders.


Summary: The number of total iteration was 1. Total 11 assertions were run. Total 11 assertions passed with 0 skipped tests.
