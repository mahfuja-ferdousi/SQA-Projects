Dear, 
I've done API Testing of a Book Store site. 
Here, I've used GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods for creating user, generating token, submitting orders, updating orders and deleting orders, deleting user ID from the Bookstore etc.


Summary: The number of total iteration was 1. Total 23 assertions were run. Total 23 assertions passed with 0 skipped tests.
