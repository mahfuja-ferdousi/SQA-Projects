Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in https://www.pickaboo.com

The login page of this site is used for the performance test.
At first, 5 temporary mail addresses have been gathered for this test and stored as a CSV file. Then the registration of this site was done with those mails and then logged in with the same mails. Thus the test was done.


While executed 5 concurrent request, found 5 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 1 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
Server can login all the 5 users without giving any error.

Please find the details report from the attachment and  let me know if you have any further queries.
